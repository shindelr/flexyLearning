The purpose is to use HTML and CSS to manipulate elements on a web page.

Some Flexbox rules:

Use display: flex; to create a flex container.

Use justify-content to define the horizontal alignment of items.

Use align-items to define the vertical alignment of items.

Use flex-direction if you need columns instead of rows.

Use the row-reverse or column-reverse values to flip item order.

Use order to customize the order of individual elements.

Use align-self to vertically align individual items.

Use flex to create flexible boxes that can stretch and shrink.
